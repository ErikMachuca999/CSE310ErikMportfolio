# Overview

This is a small and sadly cut down version of a Choose your own adventure program made in Python. 
Heavily Inspired story from the Fallout Franchise, the cut story of The Original Fallout 3 entry
for the franchise: "Van buren". I thought of using functions for it to make less tedious, but
because of many ideas and to make it as quick as possible, I had to minimize the story and 
right out at least the endings. But all works, and made a fun time making a cut story real 
again. Used by if and else statemnets, and the time library
