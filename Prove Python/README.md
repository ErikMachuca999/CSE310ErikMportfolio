# Overview

This is my first attempt at a fully coded python program that uses my favorite website ever, Amazon! an amature perspective of coding a mini version of a Shopping site was actually very fun and rather quick. This program runs as a shoping site to lay out a shopping cart list, checks the list from user input, and allows adding, removing, and even price checking commands. 

A separate file also demonstrate breifly what a class is in Python. rather like a function, but more a blueprint made for faster made coded commands. In short, this program uses variables, functions, for and while loops, and print statements, lists, and f strings. Also included int and float commands.
