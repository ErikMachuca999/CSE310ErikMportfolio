# Overview

I created a guessing game in VS Code using The Rust Programming Language, but also showing different commands within the same rust file, showing different examples of rust programming by following the first 3 sections,"1. Getting Started", "2. Programming a Guessing Game", and "3. Common Programming Concepts"; those 3 sections from the Rust Programming Language Book.
